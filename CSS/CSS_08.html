        <h2> Position </h2>

        <!-- Static

          Static positioned elements are not affected by the
            top, bottom, left, and right properties.

            An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way;
            it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page: 
        
        -->

        <!-- <div style="position: static;
                    margin: 5px;
                    
                    border: 1px solid darkcyan;">
            This is at position Static.
        </div> -->

        <!-- Fixed 

            An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport,
             which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.

        -->
 
          <!-- <div style="position: fixed;
                    
                    border: 1px solid darkorange;">
            This is at position Fixed.
         </div>  -->

        <!-- Sticky 
        
         An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
            A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. 
        
        -->

        <!-- <div style="position: sticky;
                    top:20px;
                    border: 1px solid darkcyan;">
            This is at position Sticky.
        </div> -->

        <!-- Relative

         An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

        -->

        <div style="position: relative;
                    
                    border: 1px solid darkcyan;
                    width: 300px;
                    height: 300px;">
                    
                    This is at position Relative.
                </div>

        <!-- Absolute 
            
         An element with position: absolute; 
            is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
            if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

        -->

            <div style="position: absolute;
                        
                        border: 1px solid darkcyan;
                        background-color: darkslategrey;
                        color: aliceblue;
                        margin:-20px;">
                This is at position Absolute.
            </div>
